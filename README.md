# Real-Time Slovenian Speech Translator
This project provides a real-time speech translation system designed to support multilingual communication in academic settings. It captures spoken Slovenian, transcribes it using Googleâ€™s speech recognition, and translates it instantly into English or Serbian. A built-in graphical interface allows users to monitor translations live and export transcripts for later use.
# Purpose
This tool was developed to assist newly arriving Serbian students and other international students attending Slovenian universities. It enables them to follow lectures delivered in Slovenian by providing real-time translation into English or Serbian. The goal is to reduce language barriers in the classroom and promote inclusive, accessible learning environments.
# Features
- Real-time speech recognition using Google Speech API
- Instant translation into English or Serbian via Deep Translator
- Graphical user interface with side-by-side source and translated text
- Language switching during runtime
- Transcript export to .txt format
- Adjustable window transparency for unobtrusive overlay
- Console fallback if GUI is unavailable
# System Requirements
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Internet connection (required for speech recognition and translation)
- Microphone input
